				Bauski's Hello World Test
			</h1>
			<p>
				Finally got Git running on my server, and cloned my github repo so that I can make changes using my FTP and SSH.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm going to keep on making little changes to this file, as well as adding new files to practice working with git and github
				through my server SSH... Maybe something for the future would be to create a php script on the server where I can just
				input the folder and it will do all the git stuff for me?

				How to use Git and Github together as one!
			</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Go to the folder you want to create the git repo on
				</li>
				<li>
					To clone a existing github repo:
					<code>
						git clone https://github.com/bauski/hello-world
					</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you have cloned the repo you can do whatever you want to. Add, modify, delete files.
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you are done with your changes and want to see what you've done:
					<code>
						git status
					</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					If you're satisfied with your changes you can "add" your changes to the commit:
					<code>
						git add .
					</code>
					you can also just add specific files to commit:
					<code>
						git add "index.html"
					</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					Once added you can commit using:
					<code>
						git commit -m "A new commit message"
					</code>
					If you don't set a message then the default text editor will be opened so that you can set one.
				</li>
				<li>
					Finally you must do a "pull" into the branch that you choose:
					<code>
						git push -u origin master
					</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					The prompt will ask you for your username and password, and once committed you're done.
				</li>
			</ol>
